    <div id="notice">
        <p style="margin-top: 0">So the idea here is that if you are new to Asheville or just new to the filmmaking scene in Asheville, it can initially feel like an insider group when you donâ€™t know the Facebook groups or acting schools, etc. So we built a resource for the community to answer common questions so that everyone has the resources they need to create a film. This is particular to Asheville (or WNC, curious to hear input on this) and making indie films, whether shorts or features.</p>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0">This <strong>has</strong> to be a living document because things change. Out of date information is death for this project. So please, if you have a question you'd like answer, use the Contact link in the upper right. Or if you have new information for an existing answer, hover over the question and click the Update button. Thank you and welcome!</p>
