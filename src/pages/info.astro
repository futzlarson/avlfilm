  <h1>What should I know about Film Festivals?</h1>

  <p>You're an indie filmmaker with a completed film that you want to send out to play the film festival circuit, so you can network or win some laurels and awards. Congratulations!</p>

  <p>First, create a profile for your film on <a href="https://filmfreeway.com" target="_blank">FilmFreeway.com</a>. You can browse festivals by region or genre, and make lists to track submission deadlines. Every worthwhile festival has a page listed there, although some major fests like Cannes or SXSW run their own submission process on their websites.</p>

  <p>You may upload your film directly to FilmFreeway or link to a private screener on YouTube or Vimeo. Every festival is different, but on average, shorts with a runtime less than 10 minutes are much easier to program in screening blocks, though up to 20 minutes may be considered.</p>
  
  <p>Most festivals prefer that your film is unlisted or password protected, and completed within the last calendar year or two. Some festivals don't mind if your short is available to watch online so long as they are your premiere in that particular state. Major festivals like Sundance or Tribeca want your World or U.S. premiere, and will likely disqualify your submission if the film is already widely available.</p>

  <p>Catch a festival in its Early Bird submission window for affordable fees between $5 and $20 or before their final deadlines, which can be closer to $50 or $100. It is always best to submit early to save your budget, but prepare to spend between $200 and $1000 if you want to get into a handful of notable festivals. Realistically expect between a 5 to 10% acceptance rate, so try to cast a wide net.</p>

  <p>However, when browsing FilmFreeway, beware of potential predatory festivals. Watch out for red flags like first year events, high submission fees, similar names to major festivals, or fake reviews. Submitting to free or cheap festivals is tempting but should be avoided. Another laurel on your poster is meaningless if it's an amateur festival.</p>

  <p>It's best to submit to festivals with the following positive components:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Located in film-friendly cities (like Atlanta, New York, and Los Angeles) or somewhere you want an excuse to visit</li>
    <li>Offers notable awards and prize money</li>
    <li>Local or regional so you can meet nearby filmmakers and network for potential collaboration on a future project</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Good luck!</p>
